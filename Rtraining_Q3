#By Wilcoxon, more genes are identified with significant p-values than by our t-test 
#To identify whether the Wilcoxon test or the t-test results are more appropriate, we would need to investigate whether gene expression across both groups follows a normal distribution 
#Should they follow a normal distribution, we would more readily rely on the t-test results and vice-versa for the Wilcoxon test 
#What remains true across both the Wilcoxon and t-test results is that the overall distribution of our p-values remains skewed to the right, meaning the majority of genes are not expressed at levels that are significantly different between the two groups
