#To this point all the analyses have been performed using standard R functions.  Fortunately the BoutrosLab repository has a variety of functions that will aid in making the plots and statistics.  Modify your code to use:
#a) BoutrosLab.statistics.general	for all p-value extraction functions
#b) BoutrosLab.plotting.general		for all plots
#Make these modifications for all questions from Q2 onwards.

#I used the boutros lab functions all of the Qs and not the standard R functions so was done this way already (on accident) :D
